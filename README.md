- On the left sidebar under "My calendars", hover over the calendar you want to use and click the three dots that appear.
- Choose "Settings and sharing."
- Scroll down to the "Integrate calendar" section.
- You will see the "Calendar ID" there (itâ€™s often an email-like address).
- Copy the calendar ID and paste it into the 'screenBlockerConfig.cfg' file, under the [google] section as the value for the calendar_id.

## Use case

This is for a golf simulator. The simulator is booked in 15min+ slots.
The screen blocker is a webpage that displays a message when the event ends or when there is no event active in the Google Calendar. The message is displayed in a Chrome browser in kiosk mode.

## Actions

- 5min before an event start, we remove the screen blocker.
- At the exact time of the event end, if there is no other event after,
  we put the screen blocker with this message (default message):
    "all good things come to an end, your time is up.
     If you would like to extend, please add time to your booking via the le birdie app.
     Thanks for playing!"
  (the message will be french and english)
- after 20sec of the default message, the message fade-out and a padlock is displayed.
  The padlock will bounce around to save the projector lamp.
- If there is another event (back-to-back booking) immediately following,
  at the exact time of the event end,
  we display the screen blocker for 20 seconds with this message (backtoback message):
    "all good things come to an end, the next booking is ready to begin.
     Have a great day!"
  (the message will be french and english)
- at boot, if no event in the next 5min, we display the screen blocker.
  with the default message.
